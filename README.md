# Addis Software Summer Internship Test Project

> Name - Tewodros Berhanu

This is my project submissiom for the internship program.
The app is a simple react app that uses Mirage.js as the backend mock, with a list of songs obtained from apple music public API.

## Project Structure

Backend Mock(Mirage) => './src/mirage'
Contains the backend APIs for the basic CRUD functionality. The base list of songs is obtained from 'songs.json',
which is autogenerated on app start by './src/mirage/data/fetch-songs.ts' ('npm start' script runs this first).
The songs are fetched from two sources:
1. "https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topsongs/limit=100/json" provides a list od the top 100 songs on iTunes
2. "https://itunes.apple.com/search?" which is the public search API, where it also searches for songs from a few,selected albums

The songs are then saves to songs.json, which is then used by the mirage backend mock. (songs.json acts like a source db even though its not changed later)

The frontend uses Redux-toolkit and Redux-saga for state management and API interaction
The main store can be found in './src/store/store.ts' and './src/store/songs/' holds the song reducers(slice),saga and type.

index.tsx is the main entrypoint to the app, app.tsx is the main component,and all subcomponents can be found in './src/components'

## Features

[ ] Mirage.js mocked api with fully functional CRUD functionality (persists until page reload)
[ ] List of paginated songs, with offset based pagination that is backend driven. (backend only serves songs on the current page until requested)
[ ] Redux-toolkit and Redux-Saga for state manahement
[ ] Locally stored list of favorite songs and a favorites menu.
[ ] Placeholder image direct from codebase (loaded using webpack - one of the requirements specified is slecial file specific rules for webpack)
[ ] Emotion/Syled styling with light and dark themes

[ ] Handwritten readme from phone because mebrat :( (sorry for typos, i tried)
